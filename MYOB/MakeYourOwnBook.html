<p>Hi Welcome today I will be talking about how to write your own book it's <b>easy and fun</b>,lets get started!</p> 
<p>You will need to get the setting and charecters. Then will need to think up of what your story theme will be (adventure,horror and ect...)</p>
<p><i>First you need a simple plan. Think of it like a burger, First there is the bun that can be your starting. Then you will have your lettuce, this will be used to lead up to your problom in your story. Then ofcource you have the patty now that will be your promblom! Lastly your bun that is your conclution</i></p>
<p>After you get your plan ready make sure to make your reader be intrested in your story you need to drag them in. But how? you ask well its simple you need you reader to feel sorry for your main charecter and if they face troubles and chaleges the reader will want to see if your charecter survives or dies. you might even end in a cliffhanger! </p>
<p>We are not done yet just before you make your story i would like to ask you to reread your work check if it makes scene and has good grammer. Then you can check if its good and might even publish it!</p>
<p>thank you for comming to my website I hope it help you publish or just write a book! but most important thing when you are writing a book... HAVE FUN!!!</p>
